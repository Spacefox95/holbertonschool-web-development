# HTML, advanced

## Description

This directory is dedicated to learn standard html elements. The gloal of this project is to recreate a webpage already designed on figma. So,
I had to implement every parts of this page in order to duplicate it in HTML only for now. It includes a doctype, the html langage, the meta charset, a head, a body containing a header, a main and a footer. This page also contains titles of different types, images and videos to learn all
the main tags and attributes used in this markup langage.
